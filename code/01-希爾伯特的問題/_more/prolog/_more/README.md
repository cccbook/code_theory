===============

Some simple examples for new Prolog programmers.
Varying degrees of polish. Have fun.

## finished examples

###  detective problem

These are two approaches to solving a detective's problem.
She's interrogated three witnesses to a murder, all of whom are also suspects.
The problem is to determine which of the suspect's testimony is
inconsistent with the others.

 * detectivepuzzle.pl - My original solution, written when I was new to Prolog.
It now feels very 'imperative'
 * newdetective.pl - I recently rewrote it
 * adriandetective.pl - Adrian King's solution


### talespin2.pl

Implementation of a classic story generator
(note that a far better implementation is at https://github.com/SWI-Prolog-Education/talespin-annie)

### tictactoe.pl

Implementation of tic tac toe

### birds.pl

 The birds example from the 'expert systems in Prolog' tutorial
 by Amzi (on the web)

### cannibals2.pl

 A well commented example of the cannibals/missionaries problem

 This was used as an example for a talk whose notes are in may15version.txt

 cannibals2nocomments.pl has fewer comments, but has some additional capabilities

### cuttutorial.pl

A little story analogy to help understand cut and cut, fail

### emoticons.pl

 A joke. I'm known for my happy array of 'smiley' emoticons. Sometimes others
 have trouble understanding my smileys.  This program purports to help.

### familytree.pl

 The classic familytree example. This one has two separate families in it.
 (left as exercise for the reader to find the two disconnected groups).

### socketdemo.pl

 Demonstration of reading from a socket

## Constraint examples

 Examples of CLPFD

### addlists.pl

 Constrains two lists to pairwise add to a third.

### children.pl

 A fully worked problem involving seating children in a classroom

### constraintolist.pl

 A fully worked problem, constraining a variable to be a member of a list.

### sudoku.pl

 Solves a Sudoku puzzle by CLPFD

### loops.pl

 Demo of various ways to do in Prolog what you'd do with loops in
 an imperative language.

### nqueens.pl
Implementation of the generalized version of the classic 8-queens problem.

### techtree2.pl

solve game 'tech tree' problems using CHR.
